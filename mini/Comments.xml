I still think the problem is multi-dimensional, but I guess we'll just have to wait for the author to clarify :)" CreationDate="2008-09-06T14:30:40.217" UserId="2495" />

  <row Id="82190380" PostId="47608061" Score="0" Text="@SajUsman if you are about to change the complexity, the total complexity won't be lesser than O(VE). Suppose you have 2 loop each iterating over n, the complexity would be O(n^2). Now imagine that the inner loop goes 1,2,...n times. Computing this sum (1+2+...n) will results to n(n+1)/2 which is also O(n^2)." CreationDate="2017-12-03T06:58:43.660" UserId="748188" />

About onBlockSnapped, just want to make sure: does it get called when it starts to snap, before the snapping finishes ? I ask because of its name... Is it also possible to know when it has finished snapping? Does it work as I wrote, like a ViewPager, so that when you fling fast, you still move just one page?"
